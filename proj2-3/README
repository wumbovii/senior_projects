The files here are intended to be helpful, NOT to limit what you can do.
>>Ignore them entirely, if you prefer!<<  However, as indicated in the handout,
whatever you turn in must satisfy the following criteria:

1. 'gmake' must compile your program from scratch, producing an executable
   file 'apyc' in this directory.
2. 'gmake check' must run all your tests against your ./apyc program.
3. 'gmake APYC=PROG check' must run all your tests against the program
   PROG.
4. The command
      ./apyc --phase=1 FOO1.py
   must produce AST file FOO1.ast.
5. The command
      ./apyc --phase=1 -o BAR FOO1.py
   must produce AST file BAR.
6. Likewise, --phase=2 produces decorated, semantically analyzed trees in 
   FOO1.dast and BAR.
7. Your program must exit with code 1 if there are any errors in any of the
   files, or if there are other errors (such as missing, unreadable, 
   or unwritable files).  It must produce a proper error message for syntax
   errors.
8. Your program must exit with code 0 otherwise.
8. We have also added a -dp option, which turns on parser debugging
   output when present.

Don't let anything in your finished program remain mysterious to you.
Try to understand everything that's here, and if you can't, then feel
free to ask us what's going on.

We judge your program by how it runs ON THE INSTRUCTIONAL SYSTEMS.  It's 
no good protesting that it works at home; your "customer" is not running on 
your home setup!

Be sure to submit your program properly (by copying to your teams (NOT your
personal) tags directory as proj1-N for integer numeral N.  I further suggest
that you check out the tag directories that you submit into new working
directories and make sure they compile and run properly (so that you can 
see if you are accidentally missing files).

The current contents of the files here are extremely skeletal.  Don't expect
that just because you see a class in the skeleton, it is complete.  
Furthermore, you are free to change or discard ANY PART of it as long
as your final program works according to spec.

Likewise, the tests are completely inadequate.

If you add a new source file, be sure to modify Makefile appropriately,
and 'svn add' it as well.  If you remove a file, modify Makefile and 
'svn remove' the old file.  Whenever you add or remove a file, or add, 
remove or modify an #include statement, be sure to run 'gmake depend'.
This keeps the Makefile informed of what depends on what.

MANIFEST:

     	            definitions for a few widely used AST subtypes.
        exprs.cc:   AST subclass definitions for expression-related types.
	stmts.cc:   AST subclass definitions for statement-related types.
	tokens.cc:  Definitions of token (leaf) AST subclasses.

	README:     This file.

	staff-version: A tag file used to identify the version of the staff
	            skeleton that was last merged into the source
	            files.

        tests/
            tests/test-proj1:  A testing script for project 1.  It
                     runs the compiler, unparses the resulting AST,
                     runs Python on the result, and checks the output.
            tests/test-proj2:  A testing script for project 2.  It
                     runs the compiler, unparses the resulting AST,
                     runs Python on the result, and checks the output.

            tests/correct2/     Tests that are supposed to be correct programs
                     for phase 2:
	        trivial.py, trivial.in, trivial.std:
		     A sample program, input file, and expected output file.

            tests/error2/       Tests that are supposed to cause errors for
                     phase 2.
	        triviallybad.py:
		     A sample erroneous program.
